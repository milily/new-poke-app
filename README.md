# New Poke App

url site: [https://newpokeapp.netlify.app/](https://newpokeapp.netlify.app/)

Using Pokemon's API I built this page showing on cards every single pokemon<br/>
Each pokemon card has an image and pokemon types. Also, when you click a card, it pops up a modal in which you can see a front and back sprite from the pokemon you choose, it also shows info about pokemon's ability.
